# 🧠 AI Knowledge Base Search & Enrichment  
*A lightweight RAG system with document upload, semantic search, and contextual reasoning.*

---

## 🚀 Overview  
This project implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline using **FastAPI** (backend) and **Streamlit** (frontend).  
It allows users to upload text or PDF files, semantically index them into a **Chroma vector database**, and query the knowledge base using natural language.  
Each answer is supported by **citations**, **confidence scores**, and **domain-specific retrieval**, with **DuckDuckGo auto-enrichment** for missing information.

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Backend:** FastAPI  
- **Frontend:** Streamlit  
- **Vector Store:** ChromaDB  
- **Embeddings:** HuggingFace MiniLM-L6-v2  
- **LLM:** GPT-4o-mini (OpenAI)  
- **Enrichment:** DuckDuckGo Search (ddgs)

---

## 🧩 Features
- Upload and embed TXT/PDF documents into Chroma collections.  
- Ask natural-language questions across all domains.  
- Retrieve contextual answers with reasoning and confidence.  
- Display citations with similarity scores and snippets.  
- Auto-enrich incomplete responses via DuckDuckGo summaries.

## 🧠 Example Query
> “Summarize key financial, HR, and sustainability insights from all documents.”

---

### 🧾 Sample Output
```json
{
  "answer": "AlphaTech reported 10% growth and 14% margins...",
  "confidence": 0.6,
  "citations": [
    {"filename": "financial_report.txt", "score": 1.39, "domain": "finance"},
    {"filename": "hr_policy.txt", "score": 1.72, "domain": "hr"}
  ],
  "reasoning_summary": "Financial and HR data found; sustainability missing."
}
```

## 🧩 Design Decisions
- Separated domain-based Chroma collections for better retrieval accuracy.
- Used MiniLM embeddings for speed and semantic precision.
- Implemented structured JSON responses for transparency and consistency.
- Added DuckDuckGo fallback enrichment for missing context.
